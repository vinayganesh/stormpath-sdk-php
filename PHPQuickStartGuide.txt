PHP Quickstart Guide

The PHP SDK can be found on Github.

1. Sign up for service.

	1. Provide your first and last name, email address, company, and a password.
	2. When all fields are complete, click Start. You will receive a registration success email.
	3. In the confirmation email, click the link.
	4. Follow the onscreen instructions. After completing this process, you are ready to use Stormpath for free!

2. Download the PHP SDK:

   stormpath-sdk-php - Official PHP SDK for the Stormpath REST+JSON API

3. Follow the installation/configuration directions located on the README.md file.

4. Create your API key.

	All requests to the Stormpath REST API must be authenticated with an API key. To get an API key:

	1. Log in to the Stormpath Admin Console using the email address and password provided during sign-up.
	2. After logging in, navigate to your account page by clicking Settings, My Account in the top-right corner of the screen.
	3. On the Account Details page, under Security Credentials, click Create API Key.

		a. This will generate your API key and download it to your computer as an apiKey.properties file.
		b. If you open the file in a text editor, you will see something similar to the following:

			apiKey.id = 144JVZINOF5EBNCMG9EXAMPLE

			apiKey.secret = lWxOiKqKPNwJmSldbiSkEbkNjgh2uRSNAb+AEXAMPLE

	4. Store your API key file somewhere secure (readable only by you), for example:

			~/.stormpath/apiKey.properties

	   The file contents should contain the following name/value pairs (using your own values of course):

	   $ cat ~/.stormpath/apiKey.properties

	        apiKey.id = YOURAPIKEYIDHEREREPLACEME
            apiKey.secret = YoUrReAlLyLongSecretValueHereReplaceMeWithYourValue

    5.  edit composer.json file with following contents:
    	
    	"repositories": [
    	{
        	"type": "vcs",
        	"url": "https://github.com/TomHAnderson/StormpathClient-PHP"
    	}
		],
		"require": {
    		"stormpath/stormpath": "dev-master"
		}

	6. Install composer via curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php (on windows, download http://getcomposer.org/installer and 	 execute it with PHP) and from the terminal:

	   run php composer.phar install

    7. Configure your application to create a Stormpath SDK ApiKey instance based on your API Key. The ApiKey Instance is the 
       Starting point for all operations with the Stormpath service.
    		
    		use Zend\Config\Reader\Ini as ConfigReader;
    		use Stormpath\Service\StormpathService;

    		$reader = new ConfigReader();
        	
        	$config = $reader->fromFile('/Users/vganesh/.stormpath/apiKey.ini');
        	
        	$id = $config['apiKey']['id'];
        	$secret = $config['apiKey']['secret'];

        	StormpathService::configure($id, $secret);

    6.  Use the ResouceManager instance to interact with your applications, directories, accounts, and tenants:

    		$resourceManager = StormpathService::getResourceManager();

    		$account = $resourceManager->find('Stormpath\Resource\Account', $resourceId);

    	More information on how to use the ResourceManager for creating, editing and deleting resources follow the Readme.md file.  

    7.  Register Applications.

    	To register an application, 

    		1. Get the resourceManager instance.
    		2. Instantiate an application.
    		3. Set the application properties.
    		4. Persist the application instance.
    		5. Flush the resource. 

	    	$resourceManager = StormpathService::getResourceManager();

	        $app = new Application;

	        $app->setName('Application Name');
	        $app->setDescription('Application Description');
	        $app->setStatus('ENABLED');

	        $resourceManager->persist($app);
	        $resourceManager->flush();

	8. Create accounts.

	   To create a user account, you must:

	   		1. Get the resourceManager instance.
	   		2. Get the directory where you want to create the account from the datastore with the directory href.
	   		3. Set the account properties.
	   		4. Create the account from the directory.
	   		4. Persist the account instance.
    		5. Flush the resource. 

	   		$resourceManager = StormpathService::getResourceManager();

        	$account = new Account;
       		$account->setUsername('Username');
            $account->setEmail('my@email.com');
            $account->setPassword('Password');
            $account->setGivenName('Given Name');
            $account->setMiddleName('Middle Name');
            $account->setSurname('Surname');
            $account->setDirectory($directory);
            $account->setStatus('ENABLED');

            $resourceManager->persist($account1);
            $resourceManager->flush();
